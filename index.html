            XXXTentacion, born Jahseh Onfroy, was a musician and composer. Hailing from Plantation, FL; 
            he made his name known across the globe. Known for many things besides music that connected 
            all differet walks of life, philanthropy was a huge part of who he was. As the young rapper 
            tried to change his life from negative to positive, he was met wih a tragic end. 
            Jahseh Onfroy was gunned down at a motorcycle shop in June of 2018. Jahseh ultimately succumbed 
            to his wounds. He passed at the age of 20. While alive he inspired many people to 
            love one another, to not give in to depression, and to give back.
